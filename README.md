# GitGrade-Hackathon
An AI-driven GitHub repository analyzer that acts as a recruiter mirror—scoring projects, summarizing code quality, and providing mentor-style guidance for improvement.

## Hackathon Theme
AI + Code Analysis + Developer Profiling

## Problem Statement
Students often do not know how their GitHub repositories appear to recruiters.
GitGrade AI acts as a repository mirror by evaluating real GitHub projects and
providing honest feedback and actionable guidance.

## Solution Overview
GitGrade AI analyzes any public GitHub repository and generates:
- A repository score (0–100)
- Recruiter Readiness level
- AI mentor-style improvement roadmap

## How It Works
1. User pastes a GitHub repository URL
2. GitHub API fetches repository metadata
3. Repository is evaluated using defined heuristics
4. AI generates score, summary, and roadmap

## Evaluation Rubric (0–100)
- Project Structure – 20
- Git Commit Practices – 20
- Documentation Quality – 20
- Code Depth – 20
- Recruiter Signals – 20

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- GitHub REST API

## Output
- Overall Score
- Recruiter Readiness Level
- AI Evaluation Summary
- Personalized Roadmap

## Conclusion
GitGrade AI provides students with a clear understanding of their repository quality
and a guided path to improve their developer profile.
